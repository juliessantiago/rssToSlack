### rssToSlack

A JavaScript app that reads a set of feeds and posts the new items to a Slack channel. Runs in Node.js.

#### How to

Edit config.json. If you want to continue to use the Hacker News feed, in the demo, change the urlWebHook value to one given to you by Slack for your own account.

#### Structured code

You can review the <a href="http://scripting.com/listings/rsstoslack.html">structured version</a> of the code, it might make a little more sense this way. ;-)
